# OrderBuddy
My first project on JavaFX - Simple manager for collecting orders and additional window, for customers, to display queue of their order.    
*Please be informed that purpose of this project was to test my skills of Java & JavaFX after finishing Java's Masterclass course. Hence, I've started this project and after some time decided to proceed further - to learn and practise Spring framework. Hence, since 06/04/2022 cancelling rest of tasks but not deleting them. Feel free to contribute :)*
